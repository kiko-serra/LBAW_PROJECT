## A1: Project Name

The (_PROJECT_NAME) is a project developed by a group of college students as a product targeted at college students as a way of helping them integrate easier.

The main goal of the project is the development of a web-based social network for enabling students to interact with each other in an academic context. This is a tool that can be used by students and other members of the academic environment. A team of administrators is defined, which will be responsible for managing complaints and reports.

Users are able to be verified (through a whitelist of emails associated with universities) as students, associating them with their university/faculty, altough this is not mandatory, verification allows users identify people from their university. Groups can be created and managed by the users with in-group administators being able to enforce their own rules. The users will also be able to add/remove friends and create post (being able to delete them after too), those posts will appear to their friends through their timeline which can be customized by their owner, furthermore who ever sees a post can comment it and react to it. An essential part of the social network is privacy and thus users can make their profile public or private, being shown only to their friends.

The social network will have an adaptive design so that users can access it through their computer, phone or tablet and have no problems associated with it. The user interface will also be simple and as easier to navigate as possible so that the user can go straight to the point.
